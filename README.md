# To-Do-List
# Project Description
This project is a full-stack To-Do List application developed using Laravel RESTful APIs for the backend and core PHP for the frontend. The application allows users to perform all basic task management operations such as creating, viewing, updating, and deleting tasks.
#Project Overview

The application is divided into two parts:

Backend: Laravel REST APIs handling all CRUD operations and database interaction using MySQL.

Frontend: Simple PHP files that consume the APIs using HTTP requests (cURL), providing a user-friendly interface.

The project is structured in a clean and modular way so that recruiters and reviewers can easily understand the flow and architecture.
